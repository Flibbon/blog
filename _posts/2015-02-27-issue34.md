As the mobile landscape unfolds before us, we continue to face a tough decision: remain in settled territory or venture into the unknown? There are exciting challenges in supporting new devices and technology, but often we're on our own. Mobile designer Caleb Andrews discovered this first-hand as he took on the task of designing extensions for MailChimp’s iOS app. He returned unscathed from the wilderness to tell his tale.

Caleb is joined in this issue by guest contributor [Jessica Ivins](http://centercentre.com/about/jessica-ivins), one of [Center Centre’s](http://centercentre.com/) inaugural faculty members. Jessica gives us a peek at how things are going at the “Unicorn Institute” (which was [successfully funded](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jmspool/unicorn-institute-courses-to-shape-the-future-of-u) on Kickstarter one year ago this week) and shares her story about building a learning-centered culture.
